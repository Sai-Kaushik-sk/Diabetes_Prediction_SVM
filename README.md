# Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine:

## Introduction:

Developed a machine learning model to predict whether a person is diabetic or non-diabetic using a Support Vector Machine (SVM), a supervised learning algorithm widely used for classification tasks. The model was implemented in Python, leveraging libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical computations, and scikit-learn for building and evaluating the model.

## At a glance:

Objective: Build a model to predict if a patient is diabetic or non-diabetic.
Tools to build the model: Built in python using libraries like Numpy, Pandas and Scikit learn
Data: Has been collected from Kaggle 

## Tasks:

1) Imported the dependencies
2) Collection and analysis of the data
3) Standardized the data
4) Split the data into train and tes
5) Trained the model
6) Evaluate the model using accuracy score
7) Making a predictive system
